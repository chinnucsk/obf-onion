onion:run(N) prints Nth Fibonacci number, but it can do much more...

What this is:
(added on 2011/08/14)

onion.erl has an interpreter for a stack-based language inside of it, as well as a program in that language that calculates the Nth Fibonacci number. Several features of Erlang are used to obfuscate the code: parse_transform, undefined_function, dynamic compilation of modules, and function names as any atoms.
